# Workflow for the surface cleaning of the emulsion layer of audio tape.

## Overview

The following is a workflow for the surface cleaning of the emusion layer of audio tape. It is mechanical process that may reduce debris (tape shed and other particulate matter). 

Tool and supply list:

splicing block  
straight-edge razor
RTI tissue, or comparable non-woven fabric
leader tape
Tape deck

The deck used in this workflow description is the Studer A80 RC.    

  
## Workflow
   
1)  Cut a 3 to 4-inch piece of RTI cleaning tissue, or comparable non-woven cleaning fabric.  

*Example: RTI cleaning tissue*

2)  Put one of the long edges of the the cleaning tissue into the splicing block.  Score and crease the excess tissue tightly into the splicing block.  

   
    

*Example: cleaning tissue creased and scored into a splicing block*

3)  Lay a piece of leader tape on top of the scored tissue, still in the block.   Work the leader tape and tissue down into the block to secure both into place.  
 
      
*Example: leader tape securing the cleaning tissue in place*

4)  With a straight-edge razor, cut the secured tissue down to a 1/4-inch strip.

*Example: cleaning tissue cut to a 1/4-inch width*

5)  Put the audio tape to be cleaned onto the take-up side of the deck.  Put an empty reel on the supply side of the deck, and thread the audio tape's leader tape onto it.  Loop the trimmed cleaning tissue onto the notch of the Edit Lifter.  

      
*Example: cleaning tissue being placed on the Edit Lifter*

6)  Move the Edit Lifter forward to put the cleaning tissue in contact with the emulsion layer of the audio tape.  
  
      
*Example: the Edit lifter moved forward to place the tissue in contact with the audio tape*

7)  Simultaniously, wind the audio tape onto the supply side reel, and --in the opposite direction of the winding audio tape -- slowly pull the the cleaning tissue forward.

      
*Example: audio tape and cleaning tissue moving in opposite directions*

8)  Repeat as needed.  One pass, however, is normaly sufficient.  

      
*Example: cleaning tissue with debris lifted from the emulsion layer of squeeking Scotch 176*

*Example: four cleaning tissues with debris lifted from the emulsion layer of Ampex ??? with sticky shed syndrome; the cleaning occured after baking*
